🎓 Student Performance Analysis using PySpark & Python

🚀 Overview

This project explores and analyzes student performance data using PySpark and Python.
The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about how study habits, attendance, and lifestyle factors influence academic achievement.

💡 Project Objective

Education is full of hidden patterns — this project aims to reveal them.
By cleaning, transforming, and visualizing a comprehensive dataset of students’ academic and personal metrics, we gain data-driven understanding that can support smarter educational decisions.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

- PySpark – for distributed data processing
- Pandas – for structured data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for vivid visualizations
- Google Colab – for cloud-based computation and experimentation

📊 Key Insights

- Students with higher attendance rates and consistent study hours tend to achieve better results.
- A positive correlation was found between discipline, engagement, and academic success.
- Visual patterns highlight the impact of study behavior on performance.

🎨 Visualizations

The project includes dynamic, high-contrast charts with vibrant color palettes that clearly illustrate trends and performance patterns.
